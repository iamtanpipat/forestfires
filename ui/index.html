      <h2 >What is PM, and how does it get into the air?</h2>
      <img src="PM.jpg" alt="Pm2.5" width="700" height="350">
     <br><br><p>

PM stands for particulate matter (also called particle pollution): the term for a mixture of solid particles and liquid droplets found in the air. Some particles, such as dust, dirt, soot, or smoke, are large or dark enough to be seen with the naked eye. Others are so small they can only be detected using an electron microscope.
Particle pollution includes:<p>

• PM10 : inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 10 micrometers and smaller; and<p>
• PM2.5 : fine inhalable particles, with diameters that are generally 2.5 micrometers and smaller. <p>

 How small is 2.5 micrometers? <p>
Think about a single hair from your head. The average human hair is about 70 micrometers in diameter – making it 30 times larger than the largest fine particle.
Sources of PM
These particles come in many sizes and shapes and can be made up of hundreds of different chemicals.
Some are emitted directly from a source, such as construction sites, unpaved roads, fields, smokestacks or fires.
Most particles form in the atmosphere as a result of complex reactions of chemicals such as sulfur dioxide and nitrogen oxides, which are pollutants emitted from power plants, industries and automobiles.

      <h2>What is Fire Rediative Power?</h2>
      <h5>Forest Fire </h5>
      <img src="frpinfo.jpg" alt="frpinfo" width="700" height="350"><br><br>
      <p>Variety of radiation power of wildfire was investigated by processing TERRA/Modis imagery in 4 µm spectral
band. Fire radiative power (FRP) was used for calibrating high-temperature event database obtained by the satellite
technique. An analysis was performed on the database of Siberian wildfires for 2010–2012. Dynamics of FRP was
investigated for a number of wildfires including some cases of crown fire. FRP variation was evaluated for various
forest zones of Siberia. Classification of wildfires was elaborated in terms of FRP value as a GIS-layer over the territory of Siberia <p>
The use of satellite methods and products allowed to expand the area of monitoring, so as to increase the efficiency of wildfire detection, as well as to obtain more attributive information about wildfires, such as coordi-

nates, estimation of active burning area, total damaged areas, temporal characteristics of fires, etc. These are especially important for northern territories of Siberia. The satellite technique is a primary means for wildfire monitoring in this region. 
An important feature of multispectral satellite im- agery usage is assessment of radiative energy of active fire. Information obtained is important for the analysis of fire impact on vegetation as well as assessment of emissions or forecast of post-fire conditions and regen- eration dynamics. 
In the present study, fire radiative power (FRP) was investigated by using methodology of 4 μm TERRA/ Modis imagery processing (Kaufman et al. 1998). 
The aim of the study was to analyze FRP variety for wildfires in Siberia and classify wildfire database records in terms of FRP value.

      <h2>What is Carbon Dioxide?</h2>
      <h5>Carbon Dioxide</h5>
       <img src="ocinfo.jpg" alt="ocinfo" width="700" height="350"><br><br>
       <p>Martin Wooster, one of the study’s authors and an earth observation science professor at King’s College London, says the data produced from the study were based on satellite observation and on-site measurement of the air in Palangkaraya, the capital city of Central Kalimantan province which experienced the thickest smog during the 2015 fires.

“There have been some isolated studies before where people artificially set fires in the lab to try to understand the chemical characteristics of peatland fire smoke in Indonesia. But no one had done this for natural fires, and especially not on the kind of extreme fires seen in 2015. We are the first people to do that,” says Wooster.<p>

The methodology of Wooster’s team has resulted in more reliable data compared to previous studies. On-site measurement found that the smog was composed mainly of carbon dioxide, carbon monoxide and methane.<p>

Wooster believes their study is more than enough to prod the Indonesian government to take serious steps in overcoming the problem because its impact has been severe and life-threatening.<p>

“Every year, the global atmospheric CO2 concentration is rising, and in 2015 it rose more than any other year since measurements began. The governments are very aware of the issue, primarily because carbon dioxide was released along with smoke that ​greatly impacted the air quality of the [South-East Asian] region, not only of Indonesia,” he says.<p>

Wooster notes the particulates in the atmosphere in some parts of Indonesia reached more than five times the hazardous levels, reducing visibility to a few hundred metres in places.<p>

Sugarin, head of the Climatic and Meteorological Agency (BMKG) station in Riau, Sumatra, admits that the Indonesian government is now more serious in tackling the issue although he says El Niño will not come again this year, and “the dry season will not bring severe drought as well”.<p>

<h2>Where do we get the data from?</h2>
      <p>ECMWF is the European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts.<p>

They are both a research institute and a 24/7 operational service, producing global numerical weather predictions and other data for our Member and Co-operating States and the broader community. The Centre has one of the largest supercomputer facilities and meteorological data archives in the world. Other strategic activities include delivering advanced training and assisting the WMO in implementing its programmes.

They operate two services from the EU’s Copernicus Earth observation programme, the Copernicus Atmosphere Monitoring Service (CAMS) and the Copernicus Climate Change Service (C3S). They also contribute to the Copernicus Emergency Management Service (CEMS).</h5>
