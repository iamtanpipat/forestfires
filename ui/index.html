      <h2>What is PM 2.5?</h2>
      <img src="PM.jpg" alt="Pm2.5" width="600" height="350">
     <br><br><p>
Due to the many adverse effects fine particles can inflict on a large number of people, PM2.5 is one of the major pollutants closely monitored by health authorities around the world. You will most likely come across a dedicated column for PM2.5 alongside the Air Quality Index (AQI), Pollutants Standards Index (PSI) or the air quality standards adopted by your country.</p><p>
On a very clear and non-hazy day, the PM2.5 concentration can be as low as 5 μg/m3 or below. The 24-hour concentration of PM2.5 is considered unhealthy when it rises above 35.4 μg/m3.</p><p>
Why 24-hour and not a shorter duration when evaluating the health impact of fine particles? This is because the potential damage caused by air pollutants depends not just on the concentration, but also on the duration of exposure. The longer you are exposed to PM2.5, the higher the risk of developing adverse effects caused by the exposure. That’s why a 24-hour measurement is a better reflection of the health effects of fine particles than say a three-hour reading.</p><p>
The table below will give you a sense of what levels of PM2.5 are harmful and the appropriate precautions you need to take. It is based on the air quality standards for particle pollution published by the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency

      <h2>What is Fire Rediative Power?</h2>
      <h5>Forest Fire April 17th, 2020</h5>
      <img src="frpinfo.jpg" alt="frpinfo" width="600" height="350"><br><br>
      <p>Forest fires ravaged northern Thailand in late March, following severe bushfires in the Amazon, Australia and Indonesia in 2019. The bush fire has finally been brought under control, but it has left behind extensive environmental damage. Not only is there a loss of flora and fauna, but it has also brought about serious air pollution, causing the upper North to choke under a toxic shroud.</p>

      <h2>What is Organic Carbon?</h2>
      <h5>Organic Carbon</h5>
       <img src="ocinfo.jpg" alt="ocinfo" width="600" height="350"><br><br>
      <p>Total organic carbon (TOC) is the amount of carbon found in an organic compound and is often used as a non-specific indicator of water quality or cleanliness of pharmaceutical manufacturing equipment.</p>
